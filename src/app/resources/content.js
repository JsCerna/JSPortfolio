        description: <>I graduated from Universidad del Desarrollo with a degree in Business Administration, specializing in Marketing and Finance, in 2019. During my studies, I interned at a fast-food establishment, where I managed shift scheduling, resolved conflicts, and ensured excellent customer service. I also led inventory management and handled purchasing tasks. <br></br><br></br>
        In 2019, I worked on a thesis project involving the creation of a bike park, where I focused on marketing strategies, financial management, and customer service. I led advertising campaigns and coordinated social media communication to engage with users.<br></br><br></br>
        During the pandemic, I completed my Commercial Engineering studies, and in 2023, I pursued a Full Stack MERN Developer bootcamp to expand my technical knowledge. While I haven’t yet worked in IT, I am eager to apply my skills and passion for technology in this field. I am confident in my potential to succeed in IT roles, as well as in marketing, where my creativity, attention to detail, and organizational skills set me apart.<br></br><br></br>
        In 2024, I moved to Australia, where I gained experience in farm and warehouse roles, most recently as a Warehouse Supervisor at Mountain Blue. In this position, I developed a database system for inventory management, maintained stock accuracy, and managed logistics tasks, including coordinating personnel and collaborating with the marketing team to ensure the efficient distribution of products..</>
